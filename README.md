# CDDb
Working files for the Collective Dialectic Database

This software - originally conceived 2015 by Craig Danz of Seattle WA - is currently being independently developed by its creator. 

Software is not live currently. For more information about the project view video explainers here: youtube.com/channel/UCmZ6O975ijWClCioK06_f6A

A kanban board is being maintained for the 2.0 launch of the software here: https://trello.com/b/dRapHtMx

**Personas**

1. Builder – A single person independently developing the software i.e. me. I find it easier to fit all things into a user story with this. 

2. Admin – The user tasked with keeping the system stable and tasked with any maintenance or troubleshooting.  

3. Creators – Based on the 90-9-1 rule, these are the 1%. The users who build out dialogues to a great enough degree that it allows other contributors to enrich them. The people are motivated to have their and/or others’ views captured on the particular topics they build out. 

4. Contributors – These are the 9% of the 90-9-1 rule. These people will assert opinions on arguments and weigh in with the available assertions but are less likely to create new connections or completely unique arguments. They may dabble when they feel there is a glaring omission but are content for the most part to record their views given the available information already on record. 

5. Lurkers – The 90% who will come almost exclusively to consume the results of the CDDb process. They want to know simply what people think and why without necessarily weighing in themselves. 

6. Public Trust – This is a stakeholder that we don’t think of as ever interfacing with the software but must be accounted for nonetheless. Since the CDDb is intended to be a new public reference and resource great care must be taken to maintain its credibility as an unbiased view into public opinion. Some issues around security and what is allowed on this platform may be in the interest of the public trust while not best for direct users. 

**About files in this repository**

This is a web-based tool accessing and interacting with a database in a public cloud. This version primarily uses PHP and JavaScript but migration to .NET and usage of C# is likely to access tools on the Azure stack. This repository contains all software files ever produced for this project. Some will never be referenced again in the final working version because they have been rendered moot by others. The best way to find relevant files is to start from the main file and find connections as they come CDDb_main.php
